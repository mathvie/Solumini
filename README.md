# Solumini
Solumini - PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap

App developed using PHP for the back-end, HTML for the web structure, MySQL for queries and database, and finally, Bootstrap for the front.

The project needs some fixes and it will have some new features developed, like all the complete description of the companies.
I had read about include a simple protection on the forms, using "Prepared Statements" and I want to improve this in the project.


The app starts with the index.php

When you go to the admin.php (using the button "admin"), you will see all the companies saved on the database (it has a dump with the project).

The file config.php is the connection with db
The files finished with script has the mysql command for the save, edit or delete a company in the databse.
