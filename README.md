# Solumini
Solumini - PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap

This app  was developed using PHP in the back-end, MySQL for queries and data persistence, and  Bootstrap for the front-end.

The project is still in progress and there are some fixes needed. There are also some new features coming soon, as all the complete description of the companies and a concept called "Prepared Statements" that I have read about recently for including a simple protection on the forms.

The app starts with the index.php

When you go to the admin page (using the "admin" button), you will see all the companies saved on the database (it has a dump with the project data).

The config.php file has the code for the connection with the db. The files finished with "script" have each the mysql command for saving, editing or deleting a company in the database.
